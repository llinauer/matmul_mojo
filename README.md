# matmul_mojo

An implementation of matrix multiplication in Mojo

## Setup

If you have not done so, you can install mojo together with the modular package via pixi.
You can get pixi here: 

   https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/

You can check if pixi was installed successfully, by running:

    pixi --version

If the pixi command is not found, try closing and re-opening your shell.
Then, clone the repo and setup your virtual environment:

    git@github.com:llinauer/matmul_mojo.git
    cd matmul_mojo
    pixi install

Check if you have correctly installed mojo with:

    pixi run mojo --version

If you get a valid output, you are ready to go.
